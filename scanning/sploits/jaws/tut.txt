make your payload at urlencode.org (paste your payload then click encode)
in file jawsscaner.py line 11 replace your urlencoded payload
options for the jaws scanner:
python jawsscanner.py port threads
threads is how fast it scans I reccommend port 80 6001 60001
when it asks for random mode there are actually 4 options
1. Y for random mode then you enter the amount of ips to scan
2. n will give you ranges that are already in the jaws.py file (you can edit them if you want)
3. 1 it will scan a range list you put in
4. jaws will scan a list of ips you put in (the 3 lists from shodan api jaws.txt jawslol.txt jawskek)
Enjoy!
